# NFL Yards Gained Predictions
By: Aron Vekassy, Ethan Oliver


Abstract:
In the National Football League (NFL), one of the most difficult tasks given to head coaches around the league has historically been managing the game in such a way to optimize play calling, and thus, maximizing the yards gained from each play.  Ultimately, this will give them an edge over the opposing team, offering the team a higher probability of victory. Even the best offensive coaches have, at times, struggled greatly with their play calling, resulting in lopsided losses and embarrassment on a national stage.
If teams had an algorithm to predict the success of plays given the current game situation and the skill-level of available personnel, it would make their lives a lot easier. There have been attempts at such an algorithm, but simply no meaningful success, and if there was, it would likely not remain a secret for long, given the communication and turnover between NFL staff.
With so much publicly available data and a previous interest in a sport that consumes our Sundays, learning more about the intricacies of analytics seemed natural. Although we hope to uncover some useful insights into this aspect of the NFL, this project is merely an attempt to understand the difficulties in creating such an algorithm and hopefully, in the process, create something of even minimal value.
